# MITx 6.86x

**Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning**

This is a repository to store lecture notes, example code, and assignments as I work through MITx 6.86x on the edX platform.

**Course content overview**

In this course, you will learn about principles and algorithms for turning training data into effective automated predictions. We will cover:

- Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;
- Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning;
- On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep learning.

You will be able to:

1. Understand principles behind machine learning problems such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning
2. Implement and analyze models such as linear models, kernel machines, neural networks, and graphical models
3. Choose suitable models for different applications
4. Implement and organize machine learning projects, from training, validation, parameter tuning, to feature engineering

You will implement and experiment with the algorithms in several Python projects designed for different practical applications.
