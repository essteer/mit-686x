### Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning

I completed the MITx Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning course on the edX verified track between September and December 2023.

The course instruction is delivered via a series of lectures and reading materials, with graded exercises, projects, and two examinations. This repo contains lecture notes I produced during the course of the term.

Content ranges from the theoretical (linear algebra, multivariable calculus, deep-learning algorithms) to the practical, with graded assignments that involved coding various machine learning programmes such as Perceptron, Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural networks, LSTM, and reinforcement learning using Markov models.

Subject-matter includes:

- Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;
- Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning;
- On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep learning.
- Principles of machine learning problems such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning.
- Implementation and analysis of models such as linear models, kernel machines, neural networks, and graphical models.
- Implementation and organisation of machine learning projects, from training, validation, parameter tuning, to feature engineering.

MIT requires that students do not publicly disclose their code solutions to assignments and exercises; my solutions can be shared upon request.
