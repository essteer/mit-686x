# What is Natural Language Processing?

The goal of NLP is the intelligent processing of human languages, that moves beyond simply string matching (as per email spam filters, for example).

What does it mean to process language?

When should we be satisfied with our results?

The Turing Test posits that machines should be considered as intelligent, if an impartial observer was unable to distinguish between a human a machine.

But, what does it mean to produce satisfactory performance?

**ELIZA**

ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966) was the first computer dialogue system based on keyword matching.

This programme was pioneering, but was based on repetitive patterns that used simple expressions to paraphrase what the human said, or just add conversation fillers.

The system was introduced at MIT, where several assistants involved in trialing ELIZA were said to have become attached to it.

**Language technology**

The following is a broad categorisation of the current state of language technologies:

Mostly solved:

- Spam detection
- Part-of-speech (POS) tagging
- Named entity recognition (NER)

Making good progress:

- Sentiment analysis
- Coreference resolution
- Word sense disambiguation (WSD)
- Parsing
- Machine translation (MT)
- Information extraction (IE)

Still really hard

- Question answering (QA)
- Paraphrase
- Summarisation
- Dialogue
