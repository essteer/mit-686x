# Machine Learning and Prediction

Machine learning is ubiquitous:

- search queries
- content recommendation
- image analysis
- machine translation
- natural language processing
- automated assistants
- game playing (Alpha Zero, Alpha Go)
- sciences (biology, chemistry, etc)

**Brief definition**

Machine learning as a discipline aims to design, understand and apply computer programs that learn from experience (i.e., data) for the purpose of modeling, prediction, or control.

**Prediction problems**

We can make predictions about future events: the weather, stock prices, collision avoidance (self-driving vehicles), medical risk (disease recurrence), and so on.

We can make predictions about properties currently unknown:

- will I like this film?
- is this chemical soluble in water?
- what is an image depicting?
- what is a sentence in a foreign language?
